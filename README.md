# UnityCloudTest
Trying out Unity Cloud building

Following this tutorial: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/cloud-build/creating-your-first-source-control-repository

Remember:
* Add the folder containing ProjectSettings and Assets as SubFolder.
in my case that's UnityCloudTest
* Add a Scene
* Files in Unity can get very big, only commit what is needed
* Comitting, pushing, building large files takes long
* Currently Unity Cloud builds with Unity 5.3 as latest version while 5.6 is out.
